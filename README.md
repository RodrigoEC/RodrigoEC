<p>I'm a Computer Science undergraduate at Federal University of Campina Grande(UFCG) in Brazil at the 8th semester. Throughout my graduation I've been blessed with some incredible oportunities, such as the project ePol, a partnership between the brazilian Federal Police and UFCG, and the project CodeSQ, where I worked as frontend developer for the first time.</p>

<p>Well, currently I'm having the huge oportunity of been part of the first students generation to be part of the projetct <b>NuFuturo</b>, a partnership between @nubank and UFCG.</p>
  
  
Besides that, I love music :notes:, movies, tv shows and exercising. :heart:
